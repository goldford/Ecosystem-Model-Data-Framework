# Ecosystem Model Data Framework
 This started as a model framework for any ecosystem model but since drifted. 
 Currently it contains a hodge podge of scripts. 
 
 Process for prepping ECOSPACE outputs:
 1/ Run Ecospace (set up to write regional and biomass ASC outputs)
 2/ Run 'Ecospace out ASC to NC script'
 3/ Run various eval and visualisation scripts.
