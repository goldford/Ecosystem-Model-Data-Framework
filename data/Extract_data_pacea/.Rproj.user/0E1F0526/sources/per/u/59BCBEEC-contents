```{r}
# https://github.com/pbs-assess/pacea/tree/main
install.packages("remotes")    # If you do not already have the "remotes" package

remotes::install_github("pbs-assess/pacea")

```

```{r}
library(pacea)
library(dplyr)
zooplankton_sog

```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
